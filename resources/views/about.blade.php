<p>                    The importance of education technology in the process of transforming the education to cater to the needs of the 21st century is undoubted. Sri Lanka is yet to harness the benefits of education technology to shape up its education system to face the new challenges in the education sector in the new millennium. It is clear that major part of the education technology is based upon the developments in Information and Communication technology.
     </p><p>However, Students nowadays use internet to search for educational videos to learn their required subjects. And the educational videos are uploaded for the students to refer. But this is not done in a regular manner. They have failed to categorize the educational resources in internet based on the subjects, lessons and chapters. And the students are unable to clarify their questions regarding the doubts when they learn. And also, they are incapable of practicing what they have learnt by answering questions related to the lesson and chapters. Therefore, a web and mobile based educational platform for which most of the students and teachers have access to, could easily overcome these issues. Our proposed solution is a web portal and a mobile application which includes all lecture notes, test papers and videos related to lessons and also students are able solve their issues by asking question by resource persons. The system is specialized to the sir Lankan educational platform. The aim of the project is to develop an Educational web portal and mobile application for all the students and teachers which would act as a platform to efficient and effective learn, teach, share educational resources among knowledge seekers.</p><p> The system is included three main roles such as admin, teacher and students. Admin is the person who manages the system. Controlling user profiles, deactivating user accounts and deleting unnecessary contents are under adminâ€™s control. Teacher is the person who handle the content of the system. Teacher is able to upload notes, videos, question papers and lessons. Student has the ability to refer all notes, watch videos, and answer for the questions. When considering the technologies, laravel framework uses for the designing section of the system and required data stored in MySQL databases. Android studio was used for designing the mobile application and Swagger used for API. Version controlling has been done using GitHub. Before Implementation of the system, UML diagrams has been designed to check whether features are match with user requirements. After user interface of the web portal with registration form and login was designed. Finally, we have to complete web portal and mobile app with applying all the proposed features.</p>
